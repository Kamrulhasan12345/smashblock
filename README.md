# SMASHBLOCK

This repo is a simple wrapping of [hectorm/hblock](https://github.com/hectorm/hblock) designed to work with adgaurd that gets rebuilt every Monday morning.

Now the blocklist also includes [The Quantum Ad-List](https://gitlab.com/The_Quantum_Alpha/the-quantum-ad-list/-/tree/master) and removes any duplicates.

You can simple add the following url to your adguard filter list to get an extended filter list.

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smashah/smashblock/master/blocklist.txt`

or if you want one with 127.0.0.1 redirects:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smashah/smashblock/master/blocklist-r.txt`
